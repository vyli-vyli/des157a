            <h1>MY MERCH COLLECTION</h1>
            <p>Over the years, I've collected a large amount of merchandise from my favorite series and shows. Among my collection, these are some of the most meaningful pieces of merch I have.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>FANIME BADGE</h1>
            <p>Fanime was the first major convention I had ever been to. It's an anime convention held in San Jose each year, and if you're ever in the area, I would absolutely recommend it. The variety of things to do and see there are enormous; from the talent-filled panels to artist alley to even just to regular convention attendees who put so much effort into dressing up or cosplaying.</p>
            <p>I went with a small group of friends, and we had an amazing time. The food scene nearby is also mouth-wateringly good, so it's definitely an event worth making a day out of!</p>

            <h1>PERSONA</h1>
            <p>Persona is one of my all-time favorite series. The graphics and storytelling are amazing, and the music in the games are even better. To this day, when I need to concentrate on something, I'll put on the music soundtrack from the Persona games to focus better.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>ONE PIECE</h1>
            <p>One of the first shows I've watched, and one of my forever favorites. I've kept up with One Piece since my age was in the single digits, and this show has been a source of steady comfort and relaxation for me for most of my life. The fact that it's still ongoing is something I'm both amazed and reassured by. I know that when I need to unwind after a long day, I can rewatch One Piece or just leave it on in the background while I do something else.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>REBORN!</h1>
            <p>My childhood favorite, and a show that sends waves of nostalgia through me. There are always certain things or actions that send someone back to their childhood days, and this is definitely one of them.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>HONKAI STAR RAIL</h1>
            <p>My current obsession. It's a game that's enjoyed widespread popularity since its release, and I've been sucked into its influence.</p>
            <p>I fondly remember my friends and I going out of our way to drive down to another city to eat at a specific cafe simply because they were holding a temporary collaboration event with the game. We spent our day exploring what the city had to offer and bonding over the game.</p>

            <h1>NOVELS</h1>
            <p>Although I have a great love for anime and games, I also spent a large chunk of my time reading webnovels. These webnovels tend to be either Chinese or Koreanin origin, and sometimes when they get popular enough they get officially published in English. I'm a big fan of buying these novels to show my support and love for the series, and I even have a small book collection in addition to my merchandise collection.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>ORV</h1>
            <p>Last but not least, one of my most beloved pieces of merchandise is from the Korean novel, <em>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</em>. These three beautifully made prints I have show the main characters of the series, but it's the pocketwatch that I hold as one of my dearest in my collection.</p>
            <p>This pocketwatch was part of the official merch release that was only available in Korea for a limited time, and came with the full Korean book set. I had been looking for a seller for just the pocketwatch, but at the time no one was selling it so I gave up on buying it. Little did I know that a few months later, my friends would gift me a small black box for my birthday.</p>
            <p>When I opened the box and saw that watch nestled inside, I actually screamed in disbelief and happiness. It may seem like a trivial thing, but the fact that my friends remembered that I had been interested in this series and even went out of their way to find a third-party seller to gift this pocketwatch to me touched me immensely.</p>
