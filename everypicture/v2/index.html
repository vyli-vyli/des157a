            <h1>MY MERCH COLLECTION</h1>
            <p>Over the years, I've collected a large amount of merchandise from my favorite series and shows. Among my collection, these are some of the most meaningful pieces of merch I have.</p>

            <h1>FANIME BADGE</h1>
            <p>This badge is a momento of the first major convention I had ever been to. There were a variety of things to do and see there; from the talent-filled panels to artist alley to even just to regular convention attendees who put so much effort into dressing up or cosplaying. </p>
            <p>I went with a small group of friends, and we had an amazing time. The food scene nearby is also mouth-wateringly good, so it's definitely an event worth making a day out of!</p>

            <h1>PERSONA CHARM</h1>
            <p>This little charm is from one of my all-time favorite series, Persona. The graphics and storytelling are amazing, and the music in the games are even better. Whenever I need to concentrate on something, I'll put on the music soundtrack from the Persona games to focus better.</p>

            <h1>ONE PIECE POSTER</h1>
            <p>This poster is from one of the first shows I've watched, and one of my forever favorites. I've kept up with One Piece since my age was in the single digits, and this show has been a source of steady comfort and relaxation for me for most of my life. The fact that it's still ongoing is something I'm both amazed and reassured by. I know that when I need to unwind after a long day, I can rewatch One Piece or just leave it on in the background while I do something else.</p>

            <h1>REBORN! CHARM</h1>
            <p>This little charm depicts characters from my favorite childhood shows that still sends waves of nostalgia through me. I remember watching this show while sitting next to my brother; watching shows and movies together was one of the few ways we got along together without fighting.</p>

            <h1>HONKAI STAR RAIL</h1>
            <p>These two prints are from my current obsession. HSR is a game that's enjoyed widespread popularity since its release, and I've been sucked into its influence.</p>
            <p>I fondly remember my friends and I going out of our way to drive down to another city to eat at a specific cafe simply because they were holding a temporary collaboration event with the game. We spent our day exploring what the city had to offer and bonding over the game.</p>

            <h1>NOVELS</h1>
            <p>Although I have a great love for anime and games, I also spent a large chunk of my time reading webnovels. These webnovels tend to be either Chinese or Koreanin origin, and sometimes when they get popular enough they get officially published in English. I'm a big fan of buying these novels to show my support and love for the series, and I even have a small book collection in addition to my merchandise collection.</p>

            <h1>OMNISCIENT READER'S VIEWPOINT</h1>
            <p>Last but not least, one of my most beloved pieces of merchandise is from the Korean webnovel ORV. These three beautifully made prints I have show the main characters of the series, but it's the pocketwatch that I hold as one of my dearest in my collection.</p>
            <p>I had been searching for this pocketwatch for a while, but it was sold exclusively as part of a larger set and only within Korea. When I opened my birthday present later that year, I actually screamed in disbelief and happiness. The fact that my friends remembered me talking about this series and even went out of their way to find a third-party seller to gift this pocketwatch to me touched me immensely.</p>
