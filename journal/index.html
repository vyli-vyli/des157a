            <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this article</a> by Salim Ansari, 20 techniques for better form design are discussed. After reading through this page, I began to think back on a lot of the previous online forms I've seen and filled out. A lot of these forms utilized the tips and practices mentioned in this article, like chunking a form into multiple steps to minimize cognitive load or putting the more complicated questions last on the form to make the user more commited to finishing the form. I never realized how much thought and deliberation went into the way these forms were designed. For example, the e-commerce platform <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/">Big Cartel</a> hosts a lot of online stores for artists and small businesses. Everytime I buy from a business that hosts their site on Big Cartel, I notice that the checkout process use a lot of the practices mentioned in the article to streamline the process and make it user-friendly. They chunk the personal information, payment, and billing processes separately as well as distinguish the optional and required fields to make checking out simple and efficient.</p>
